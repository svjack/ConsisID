<div align="center">
This repository is the official implementation of ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human-identity consistent in the generated video. The approach draws inspiration from previous studies on frequency analysis of vision/diffusion transformers.

Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation.

[![Demo Video of ConsisID](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/634248f6-1b54-4963-88d6-34fa7263750b)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhlgC-bI5SQ)
or you can click <a href="https://github.com/SHYuanBest/shyuanbest_media/raw/refs/heads/main/ConsisID/showcase_videos.mp4">here</a> to watch the video.

## 🤗 Demo

### Gradio Web UI

Highly recommend trying out our web demo by the following command, which incorporates all features currently supported by ConsisID. We also provide [online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview-Space) in Hugging Face Spaces.

```bash
python app.py
```

### CLI Inference

```bash
python infer.py --model_path BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview
```

warning: It is worth noting that even if we use the same seed and prompt but we change a machine, the results will be different.

### GPU Memory Optimization

```bash
# turn on if you don't have multiple GPUs or enough GPU memory(such as H100), but it will cost more time in inference and may also reduce the quality
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()
```

warning: It is worth noting that even if we use the same seed and prompt but we change a machine, the results will be different.


### Prompt Refiner

ConsisID has high requirements for prompt quality. You can use [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/) to refine the input text prompt. The example is as follows (original prompt: "a man is playing guitar.")
```bash
a man is playing guitar.

Change the sentence above to something like this (add some facial changes, even if they are minor. Don't make the sentence too long): 

The video features a man standing next to an airplane, engaged in a conversation on his cell phone. he is wearing sunglasses and a black top, and he appears to be talking seriously. The airplane has a green stripe running along its side, and there is a large engine visible behind his. The man seems to be standing near the entrance of the airplane, possibly preparing to board or just having disembarked. The setting suggests that he might be at an airport or a private airfield. The overall atmosphere of the video is professional and focused, with the man's attire and the presence of the airplane indicating a business or travel context.
```

## ⚙️ Requirements and Installation

We recommend the requirements as follows.

### Environment

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID.git
cd ConsisID
conda create -n consisid python=3.11.0
conda activate consisid
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download ConsisID

The weights is available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview), or you can download it with the following command.

```bash
# if you are in china mainland, run this first: export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
huggingface-cli download --repo-type model \
BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview \
--local-dir BestWishYsh/ConsisID-preview
```

Once ready, the weights will be organized in this format:

```
📦 models/
├── 📂 face_encoder/
├── 📂 scheduler/
├── 📂 text_encoder/
├── 📂 tokenizer/
├── 📂 transformer/
├── 📂 vae/
├── 📄 configuration.json
├── 📄 model_index.json
```

## 🗝️ Training

#### Data preprocessing

```
coming soon!
```

If you want to train a text to image and video generation model. You need to arrange the dataset in this [format](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/tree/main/asserts/demo_train_data/dataname):

```
📦 datasets/
├── 📂 captions/
│   ├── 📄 dataname_1.json
│   ├── 📄 dataname_2.json
├── 📂 dataname_1/
│   ├── 📂 refine_bbox_jsons/
│   ├── 📂 track_masks_data/
│   ├── 📂 videos/
├── 📂 dataname_2/
│   ├── 📂 refine_bbox_jsons/
│   ├── 📂 track_masks_data/
│   ├── 📂 videos/
├── ...
├── 📄 total_train_data.txt
```

#### Video DiT training

Setting hyperparameters

- environment (e.g., cuda): [deepspeed_configs](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/tree/main/util/deepspeed_configs)
- training arguments (e.g., batchsize): [train_single_rank.sh](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/blob/main/train_single_rank.sh) or [train_multi_rank.sh](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID/blob/main/train_multi_rank.sh)

Then, we run the following bash to start training:

```bash
# For single rank
bash train_single_rank.sh
# For multi rank
bash train_multi_rank.sh
```
